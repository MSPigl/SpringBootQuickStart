# SpringBootQuickStart
Results of Java Brain's Spring Boot Quick Start code-along series, which I used as an introduction to Spring/Maven, as well as refreshing myself on Java. There's no frontend as the lecture series didn't get into template rendering, it just accepts HTTP requests and manipulates an Apache Derby database based on the different routes.
